# veggie-classifier
UW EE P 596 Computer Vision Final Project

To run: 
Download veggie_classifier.ipynb and put into the same directory as data/images/ (unzip data/images.zip into data/images)
Launch Jupyter Notebook via anaconda prompt and run the code from start to finish for all generated/desired results.

Note: the code takes from 3-6 hours to run depending on the hardware of your computer. There is not cuda checking since I was not able to use cuda. 
      To speed the performance of the CNN training and testing up make use of cuda and gpu if possible!
